## Introduction   

####This study intends to understand the extent of socio-economic indicators as primary education, higher education, income and their relationships to unemployment rate in the London area as of 2011. After pre-analysing the data for possible skewed distributions and correlation between variables, a multiple linear regression is performed in order to test the statistical significance of the findings.The final output of this reasearch will consist on local regression predicting to which extent the above mentioned social indicators influence the unemployment rate in London LSO areas in 2011. The inspiration for this research comes from an international project called "INEQ-CITIES" which main aim was to provide evidences of health inequalties in cities across Europe (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ineqcities). Different pubblications followed the project, interesting for this study, Borrell et al (2014) enphasise "a consistent pattern of socio-economic inqualities in mortality" in Europe emerging from socio-economic indicators such as unemployment and education levels. Similarly in this study the main objective is to identify to which extent education and median income of each Loandon small areas contribute to unmeployment for the year 2011.
####The first part relates to inferential statistic analysis, in particular a bi-variate linear regression will be perfomed and based on first results other indicators will be inserted one by one into a multiple regression model.
####The second part will consist on a geographical weighted regression (GWR) perfomed in order to visualize local aspects of the multiple regression,some predictions will be inspected as part of the overall objective.




##Data   

####The material used to develop this research comes interely from the UK Office for National Statistics (OSN https://www.ons.gov.uk/search?:uri=search&:uri=search&q=LSOA&page=3) and in particularly refers to the London Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) which are smallest geographically statistic areas containing data from the offical census of 2011(https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography#super-output-area-soa). The London Datastore website releases as well the ONS based "LSOA Atlas"" which "provides summary of demographic" and other retaled data from population segmentation to housing, land use, employment, etc. In this study the London LSOA Atlas will be the direct source of data for the following analysis, the extracted values of interest are shown in the table bellow.
```{r}
library(readr)
clean_data <-read_csv("C:\\Users\\Bogdan\\Documents\\UCL\\MRes\\GIS\\week9\\Assignment3\\clean_data.csv")
head(clean_data)

```



##Methodology


####Data extracted from the LSOA Atlas has been subject to transformation, as the socio-economic indicators are the results of normalization with the working age population.The next step involved regression analysis

##[INSERT THE CALCULATION TABLE]



### Data transformation

####The first set of variables to be extracted from the databased are the "Unemployment Rates" that accordingly to the OSN are calculated as the the total number of unemployed people divided by the active population(https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/methodologies/aguidetolabourmarketstatistics). Unemployment rates will represent in this study the dependent value based on which all the indicators will be related.
####Primary education and higher education indicators were calculated respectively as the working aged population between 16-65 that completed the first level of qualification or lower (summing unqualified population and level 1 education) from one side and the working population who obtained level 4 qualifications and above from the other, both were then divided by the total population aged 16-25.
#### Finally the fourth variable resulted from the household median income annual estimates for the year 2011-2012 and divided by the working aged population. Median values were chose instead of mean ones, due to the fact that eventual outliers may raise the mean values in the social context as that of London.
####The following table illustrates the indicators calculated values that will be examined in depth in the next paragraphs.

```{r}
## A new object called "social_indicators"" will contain the indicators

# First we sum the two primary education levels:
social_indicators$Primary_education <- clean_data$No_qualifications+clean_data$Level_1_qualifications

# Secondly we divide it by the working population:
social_indicators$Primary_education_Indicator <- social_indicators$Primary_education/clean_data$Working_age_population

# We divide as well the High education by working population
social_indicators$Higher_education_Indicator <- clean_data$Level_4_qualifications_and_above/clean_data$Working_age_population

# Income indicator finally
social_indicators$Median_income_Indicator <- clean_data$Med_Househ_Inc_estim/clean_data$Working_age_population

head( social_indicators[,c(1:3, 10:12)])
```




####In order to have a first view of how the four variables are distributed, some basic statistics were visualized followed by the density distribution plots. The quick statistics show that unemployment rate has a mean value of 7.4% in the whole London area, working population is represented by 33% of unqualified individuals and higher education covers only 43% of the working-age population. 


```{r}
summary(social_indicators[,c(1:3, 10:12)])
```


####Median household income indicator shows a mean value of 31.8, this indicates that in London the divergence between economically rich and poor LSOA areas is very large, density distribution and box plots identifies also a skewed conformation and an important range of outliers, in this case a log10 transformation seems to be a right manovre.


```{r}

D1 <- social_indicators$Unemployment_Rate
I2 <- social_indicators$Primary_education_Indicator
I3 <- social_indicators$Higher_education_Indicator
I4 <- social_indicators$Median_income_Indicator

boxplot(D1,I4, vertical=TRUE,names = c( "Unemployment Rate","Income Indicator"), col="gold", main="Unemployment and Income" )



```
```{r}
boxplot(I2,I3, vertical=TRUE, names = c( "Primary Education","Higher Education"), col="gold", main="Education indicators" )
```


```{r}

##https://rpubs.com/adam_dennett/334459 
LSOA_of_interest <- social_indicators[,c(1:3, 10:12)]
LSOA_of_interest

library(reshape2)
LSOA_melt <- melt(LSOA_of_interest)
attach(LSOA_melt)


library(ggplot2)
hist_All <- ggplot(LSOA_melt, aes(x=value)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), colour="black", 
                 fill="white") + geom_density(colour="orange", size=1, adjust=1)+
  geom_density(colour="purple",size=1.5,adjust=1)+
  scale_colour_manual(name = 'Legend', 
                      guide = 'legend')

hist_All + facet_wrap(~ variable, scales="free")



```


```{r}

social_indicators$Median_Incom_LOG10 <- log10(social_indicators$Median_income_Indicator)
boxplot(social_indicators$Median_Incom_LOG10, vertical=TRUE, name = c("Income Indicator"), col="gold", main="LOG10 Income Indicator" )

```



### Data analysis
####Once cleaned and trasformed, data are ready to be analysed for bi-variate and multi-linear regression. The following tables shows the final input data.

```{r}

analysis_indicators <- social_indicators [,c(3, 10:11, 13)]
head(analysis_indicators)
```

####As a final step towards regression analysis, Pearson's correlation shows there is an evident positive correlation of 0.47 between unemployment and primary education, higher education and income from the other side are negatively corelated between -0,61 and -0.69, meaning they contribute in droping down the unemployment.

```{r}

library(corrplot)
cormat <- cor(analysis_indicators, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")
corrplot(cormat)

```


### Hypothesis


####Taking into consideration the unemployment rates of London LSOA areas in 2011, as the unemployed working-aged population normalized by the total active population,the proposed analysis implies that the null hypothesis:

  #### H0: There is no statistically significant relation between unemployment rates and socio-economic indicators with significance level a >=0.05 and coefficients β1 = β2 = β3 = 0
  
####and the alternative hypothesys:
  #### H1: There is relationship between unemployment with significance level  a<=0,05 and at least one of the coefficients {β1 ,  β2 , 	β3 } ≠ 0
  


###Regression models analysis

####The analysis intents to prove that socio-economic indicators influence unemployment in the London area, first a simple linear regression is perfomed between unemployment rate and primary education indicator, then one by one higher education and median income will contribute to the multi-linear regression.
####The regression model used for this study consists on the following equations :
####   simple regression y = β1x1  + β0
####   multiple regression y = β1x1 + β2x2 +…+ βkxk+ β0, 
#### where β are the gradients and β0  the intersect of the variables. 

### Bi-variate regression model
 
####From the results is evident that in terms of R-squared, relations between variables are explained on average only in 22% of the cases. Beta coeficient has a positive value of 12.2, meaning each time we increase the primary education indicator by one unit, the unemployment rate will rise on average by 12.2%, in this case the model equation has the following coefficients:
####  y = 12.2(x)  + 3.29.



```{r}
qplot(Unemployment_Rate, 
      Primary_education_Indicator, 
      data = analysis_indicators,
      geom = "point",
      size = I(0.1),
       alpha =I (0.2)) + 
  stat_smooth(method="lm", 
              se=FALSE,
              col="red",
              size=1)
```


```{r}

Bi_variate_model <- lm(indicators$Unemployment_Rate ~ indicators$Primary_education_Indicator)
summary(Bi_variate_model)
```


### Multi-linear regression model

#### The next investigation consists on adding the higher education variable to the model that now shows a strong increase, peaking almost 40% of the variation in unemployment rates. The coefficients indicate a negative value of -6.41 for primary education and -17.18 for higher education, meaning that in this model both contribute on bringing down the unemployment:
####  y = -6.41(x) - 17.18(x) + 17.04
####  The three variables are plotted on a 3D graph in order facilitate the thier interpretations.The 3D regression model shows clearly the plane in incleaned when higher education rises, meaning more qualified workers in the system, less unemployment rates.

    axis.scale = FALSE)


```

```{r}

Multi_model2 <- lm(indicators$Unemployment_Rate ~ indicators$Primary_education_Indicator + indicators$Higher_education_Indicator)
summary(Multi_model2)
```

#### The final regression model comprises all variables and demonstrates an additional increase to the R-squared values treflecting 54% of fit goodness on variables. All three variables have statistical significance near to 100% as the p-value is well bellow the significance border for which a=0.05. The null hypothesis is rejected as all coefficients are different from zero and the alternative hypothesis is accepted:
####  y = 4.59(x) - 2.39(x) -12.14(x) + 24.81

####The final multi-regressional equation reflects a precise social model on which the unemployment grows on average by 4.59% each time the unqualified workers percentage rises by 1%, drops down by 2,39% each time the higher specialised workers increase by 1% and falls again down by 12.14% each time on average, median income per workers increase by 1 unit. 


```{r}
Final_model <- lm(indicators$Unemployment_Rate ~ indicators$Primary_education_Indicator + indicators$Higher_education_Indicator + indicators$Median_Incom_LOG10)
summary(Final_model)

```

####As a final proof, the residuals standadized errors are plotted with predicted values in order to underpin possible suspect clustering around variables. 

```{r}
plot(Final_model, s=10)
```

##Local regression

####The second phase of the study consists on join the findings of the multi-linear regression model and conduct a statistical spatial analysis with "local regression". The spatial dataframe shapefile used for the last part of this study derives from the data.gov.uk website and covers England and Wales (https://data.gov.uk/dataset/fa883558-22fb-4a1a-8529-cffdee47d500/lower-layer-super-output-area-lsoa-boundaries), the shapefile was clipped and merged with the data analyzed to this point.

```{r}
library(rgdal)
LondonLSOA <- readOGR("C:\\Users\\Bogdan\\Documents\\UCL\\MRes\\GIS\\Week9\\Assignment3\\Lower_Layer_Super_Output_Areas_December_2011_Full_Extent__Boundaries_in_England_and_Wales\\london_lsoa.shp", "london_lsoa")



##In order to Print a more accurate map, we need to add the lon and lat columns to the shapefile

C <- coordinates(LondonLSOA)

LondonLSOA$lon <- C[,1]  
LondonLSOA$lat <- C[,2]


```


```{r}

library(tmaptools)
LondonLSOA_Joined <- append_data(LondonLSOA,indicators, key.shp = "lsoa11cd", key.data ="Codes", ignore.duplicates = TRUE)

LondonLSOA_Joined


```


```{r}
library(sf)

LondonLSOA_SF <- st_as_sf(LondonLSOA_Joined)
LondonLSOA_SF

```


```{r}

## Copy the residuals to the joined dataframe
LondonLSOA_Joined@data$residuals <- Final_model$residuals


##Tranform data to Dataframe format for GGPLOT usage

LondonLSOA_Joined@data$id <- rownames(LondonLSOA_Joined@data)


social_unemployment <- fortify(LondonLSOA_Joined, region = "id")
LondonLSOA_DF <- merge(social_unemployment, LondonLSOA_Joined@data, by = "id")

cbind(lapply(LondonLSOA_DF, class))


head(LondonLSOA_DF)

```

#### The first phase on the spatial regression analysis is to calculate the spatial autocorrelation of the datased analysed so far. Moran's I method defines variables similarity to their sourroundings and possible spatial autocorelation may invalid the model analysed. Applied to spatial analysis, Morans's I is build on a weighted matrix that in this case is created from each LSOA centres and associated with the residual errors calculated within the model.


```{r}
library(spdep)

#####
#First calculate the centroids of all Wards in London

coordinLSOA <- coordinates(LondonLSOA_Joined)
plot(coordinLSOA)+
coord_equal() 

```


```{r}
#Now we need to generate a spatial weights matrix (remember from the lecture). We'll start with a simple binary matrix of queen's case neighbours
#create a neighbours list
LSOA_nb <- poly2nb(LondonLSOA_Joined, queen=T)
#plot them
plot(LSOA_nb, coordinates(coordinLSOA), col="orange")

```


```{r}
#create a spatial weights object from these weights
LSOA.lw <- nb2listw(LSOA_nb, style="C")
head(LSOA.lw$neighbours)

```

####Moran's I test indicates a value of -0.25 which means LSOA variables after regression are dispersed enough to treath a cluster formation. The residuals error in the maps show no particular autocorrelation between LSOA areas, the statistic model can be transposed to the spatial analysis. 

```{r}
#moran's I test - this tells us whether we have clustered values (close to 1) or dispersed values (close to -1)
#we will calculate for the densities rather than raw values


I_LSOA_Global_Density <- moran.test(LondonLSOA_Joined@data$residuals, LSOA.lw)

I_LSOA_Global_Density
```




```{r}

## Plotting Residuals on Morans's I
map3 <-  ggplot(data = LondonLSOA_DF,
               aes(x=long,y=lat.x))+
  geom_polygon(aes(group=group, fill = residuals))+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "yellow")+
  coord_equal() 
map3

```

### Geographic weighted regression

####Spatial anlysis continues with the local regression, next steps will be performed on ArcGIS software, as some technical difficulties were encountered when using the gwr function.
####When proceding with the GWR analysis in Arcgis whereven, running a OLS analysis with the arctoolbox tools revealed that the model has a variable that shows "multicollinearity" above 7.5 which prevents the GWR algorithm to run, in this case the variance inflation factor (VIF) indicates higher education variables to have a value of 7.59, it was neccessary to exclude this variable from the model in order to further investigate the WGR.

### The two maps illustrate the respective coefficients having different impact in London LSOA areas. Median income coefficient has an overall negative impact on unemployment, in red are areas that on average pull down the unemployment between 5-6%. Primary Education impacts negatively the employment, for 1% increase the unemployment rises between 19-21% on the red areas.
